Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- user can change the color theme
